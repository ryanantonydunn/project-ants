üö®‚ö†Ô∏è Very old code warning ‚ö†Ô∏èüö®

This project was built a very long time ago and is not representative of current work. This codebase is preserved as a monument - not to be ashamed of our past, but to be proud of how far we've come and what we can accomplish with limited tools.

I am very slowly undertaking a [rewrite of this project](https://github.com/ryanantonydunn/army-ants) when time permits. This will obviously take a while because the codebase is enormous.

# Project Ants

Project Ants is a multiplayer action browser game with a custom physics engine. Its main accomplishments are:

- Custom collision engine
- Large customisability of objects and weapons
- Multiplayer capable with a node server architecture
- Image based maps that can be customised
- Procedurally generated random maps
- Map based gravity
